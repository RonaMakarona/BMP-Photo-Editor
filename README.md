# BMP-Photo-Editor

My bagrut project (Work in progress)


This is a very cool graphic photo editor in C that edits BMP photos


Features: Flipping (..?) and also a Black and White filter!



## To run:


Exclude "functions.c" & "parser.c" from the build.


In the linker settings, under System, change the SubSystem to Windows.


In the preprocessor settings, add to the preprocessor definitions the following: ```_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS```
